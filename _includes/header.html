            <p>This photo gallery is a personal record of my lifelong hobby of model-making. I started in 1962 as a 10-year old kid and other than a few interludes of a year or two, I have been modelling consistently ever since. I make no claims to being anything more than an experienced journeyman - there are many modelers out there with far greater skills and accomplishments than me. Be that as it may, this is my album of achievements in the hobby.</p>
