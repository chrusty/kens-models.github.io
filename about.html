This photo gallery is a personal record of my lifelong hobby of model-making. I started in 1962 as a 10-year old kid and other than a few interludes of a year or two, I have been modelling consistently ever since. I make no claims to being anything more than an experienced journeyman - there are many modelers out there with far greater skills and accomplishments than me. Be that as it may, this is my album of achievements in the hobby.

Though my initial interest was warship models in 1/600 scale, I have built military vehicles, aircraft, cars, buildings and a few trains and trucks.
 
The Scales I have mainly focused on are:

* 1/600, 1/700, 1/350 & 1/72 for ships
* 1/35 and 1/72 for military
* 1/72 and 1/144 for aircraft
* 1/24 & 1/25 for cars
* 1/87 for buildings
 

### The Numbering System

I have given identifier numbers to all the Models I have finished. They are numbered in time sequence of completion date with the lowest M numbers being the earliest. The model biographies in jpg form on the Flickr site, share the same numbering system. I also have a separate numbering system for Projects and these are also shown on the jpg model biographies. Whenever I start a project, I identify it with a new P number, in numerical order of starting date. I keep computer files of all photos or written material relating to any each project in its respective P file. This includes photos of the un-built kit, research photos and documents I have down-loaded from web searches, along with progress photos and photos of the finished model.
 

### The Photos

The photos on the Flickr site vary widely in quality. They range between simple handheld snapshots taken with small cameras or cellphones to shots taken with a tripod-mounted DSLR camera with a remote shutter release and using a specialised macro lens on minimum aperture (for max depth of field). The photo backgrounds also vary widely from anything I could find at the time (eg, old sheets and towels) to pastel cardboard sheets and painted water-colour skies. Over time, I hope to replace the worst of the photos with more at the high quality end of the spectrum
