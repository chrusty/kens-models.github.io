Model cars were the second genre of modelling subjects I got involved in, after ships. In 1966, during the height of the slot-car craze, my father build a track for my brother and I to race slot cars on, and all three of us got our own cars. Mine was a 1/32 scale 1963 Corvette Stingray made by Nichimo. It was a plastic kit with a decently-shaped body. I built it (Model 17), raced it, modified it and eventually lost it, but the idea of model cars lived on. A few years later I bought a couple of Airfix 1/32 scale bagged car kits and built one of them, an MG1100 sedan (Model 38) in 1971-72. I did not have an airbrush back then, everything was hand-painted, and the MG was accordingly, pretty rough. I gave it away in 1979.

In 1973 or so, I got my first glimpse of AMT 1/25 trucks when I saw a collection of built examples in a modelshop in Auckland. To say I was impressed would be a huge understatement. Another year went by before I found any actually for sale and then I went for it and collected a lot of them from 1974 onwards. At this point I also decided to buy my first 1/25 car kit, the AMT 1957 Thunderbird. I started the T'Bird and a Ford C-600 truck in 1975 but I didn't get far with either. During the mid 1970s through the 1980s, modelling time was hard to come by due to the time demands of job, family life, moving to different cities and different countries etc. It was not until 1990-91 that I was able to finish these two 1/25 models. Whilst the Ford C-800 (Model 69) was a successful model, the T'Bird (Model 68) was not and I subsequently rebuilt it (Model 104) years later.

The next development in my car modelling was when a well-known and very-skilled Wellington modeler took a job with the local hobby shop and introduced me to racing car models. I got inspired by his work and bought some kits and started three of them in 1993-94. Unfortunately, tough times intervened and I made little progress on these until eventually finishing them in 1999-2000. The last of the three, the M8A McLaren (Model 96) was a huge effort and convinced me to be more careful with my kit selection. By this point, my lifelong love of American cars came to the fore again and I started collecting a lot of kits. At about this time, I discovered Ebay and I bought a number of 1/25 scale unbuilt kits and built models of American cars and 1/24 sports racing cars. My model-car renaissance was underway, and between 2001 and 2003 I built 8  models, all to 1/24, 1/25 scales, the last being the 1962 Mercury. The best of these in my opinion are the Plymouth Police Wagon, the 1940 Ford and the '62 Mercury. On and off since then, I have built a few more cars, racing cars and commercial vehicles to various scales. My favourites are the Jordan EJ10 in 1/24th (Model 139), the Fowler traction engine in 1/72nd (Model 155) and the Kenworth Cabover in 1/25th (Model 199). At the time of writing, I have no new ones underway but I plan to build more 1/24 sports racing cars and 1/25 American &quot;yank tanks&quot; in the next few years, maybe a truck as well.
