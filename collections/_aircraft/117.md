Prior to this model, I had not done any aircraft modelling for 15 years. From  1987 to 2000, I sold off 180 kits from my stash of unbuilt aircraft and kept only 10. I effectively abandoned aircraft modelling. This little kit I had bought in 1980 was one of the survivors of the purge. When my interest in aircraft modelling returned in 2006, I thought it would be a good practice project to help get me started again. I decided to display it in flying mode as a departure from aircraft modelling convention.
