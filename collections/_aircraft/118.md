I am not sure why I started this terrible early Trumpeter kit. It was the 3rd aircraft model I started in 2006, after a 15 year layoff. Possibly, I wanted another model to practice on before I started a decent kit. I think I also wanted to see if I could make a silk purse from a sows ear. The verdict is a clear no, despite putting 47 hours work into the project.
