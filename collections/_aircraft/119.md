This old Airfix kit was a gift from Modelcrafts and Hobbies, Wellingtons prime modelshop until their closure a few years ago after over 60 years in the business. I was told that the 1965 tooling was quite inaccurate but I decided to build the kit anyway. I converted it to flying mode and made some detail improvements. However, my main focus was to make a decent job of painting it as I had never previously finished a German WW2 aircraft model.
