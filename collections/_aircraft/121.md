I made this model of the Polish jet trainer from a kit by Plastyk, a re-issue of the 1991 MasterCraft tool. It featured recessed panel lines and, on the basis of reference photos, was reasonably sound in shape. I made a few modifications to upgrade the kit, but my main focus was to make a good attempt at the three-colour camo scheme on upper surfaces.
