The earliest naval jets are of great interest to me. As far as short-run kits go, in the box this one looked rough but buildable. That initial impression was inaccurate. The fuselage halves did not match - there was gross distortion of shape caused by worn out moulds. It took a huge amount of time and filler to correct the issues. Things only got worse when it came to painting. First off, the Xtracolour enamel took months to cure. It was inhibited by the Tamiya lacquer primer beneath it. After waiting patiently, I then sprayed Johnson's Klear as a gloss finish for decaling. It soon developed a network of micro cracks. I found I could not remove the Klear so I applied the kit decals anyway and the setting solution reacted with the Klear. What a mess. The whole project was a huge disappointment and a waste of time but it was a part of my experience in the hobby and so I have included photos of the model on this site.
