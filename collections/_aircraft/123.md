summary: Fairey Delta 2 WG774 as in March 1956
title: Fairey Delta 2
---

In about 1960-61, I had a kids book on modern aircraft, modern at the time anyway. The Fairey Delta 2 was amongst the 1950s aircraft featured and ever since, it has fascinated me. The old 1957 FROG tooling has been re-issued by eastern European firms for years. I bought a copy of the Novo version in 1984 but sold it in 1997. I bought this version which had been slightly modified by Maquette, in 2006. It was an absolute dog but I wanted an FD-2 so I suffered the pain and fixed it as best I could.
