I was definitely drawn to the tiger-stripe camouflage of this Chinese version of the MiG-19. It was the first project I started after retiring in May 2007. The kit was made by a Polish firm, Plastyk, though, I believe the moulds were tooled by Eastern Express in the 90s. I made quite a few detail changes/additions to the kit. I made the mistake of using only Maskol to mask for the dark green camo pattern and some edges are a little furry.
