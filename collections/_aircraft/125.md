Having lived in Australia for 9 years, I liked the idea of building a model of Australia's home-grown WW2 single seater. Airfix's 1965 kit is a good starting point though it has no cockpit interior at all. I made quite a few improvements to update the model and then went to extremes with the chipped paintwork - perhaps too far.
