Japanese WW2 twin-engined fighters and reconnaissance aircraft are some of the best-looking machines of the period in my view. I decided to build this MPM short-run injection kit because the Mitsubishi Ki-83 typifies such aircraft. I also wanted to take on the challenge of an MPM kit. It was certainly quite a tricky build as the fuselage halves were quite significantly warped and they did not align properly even after I had de-warped them. The wings and horizontal stabilisers were also butt-jointed. Nonetheless, with some extra effort it came together well and I am happy with the model.
