When I bought this Amodel kit in 2006, I have to admit, the striking box art had a lot to do with my decision. Another factor was that the first WW2 aircraft model I ever built was a 1/100 scale Yak-9P in 1969. In contrast with that earlier experience, the Amodel  kit seemed to be quite detailed and accurate in shape. Other than a few minor fit problems with the wingtips, it went together well. I painted it with Colourcoats enamels.
