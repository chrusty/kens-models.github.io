This was the last aircraft project I started during my 2006 to 2008 period of aircraft modelling. The kit was one of a handful of survivors from the purge of my aircraft kit collection in the late 1990s. I intended the model to be a quick and easy build and it was, with only a few minor issues to deal with such as getting the pilot window to fit.
