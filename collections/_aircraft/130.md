I chose this ex-FROG Sea Vixen as my 2nd aircraft project after getting my aircraft modelling mojo back in 2006. I had been given the kit by an expert aircraft modeler, David Charles, in Brisbane in 1987. It comprised a plastic bag full of loose parts and sprues, a photocopied set of original FROG instructions and some original FROG decals. The kit had survived the great purge of my aircraft kit collection in the 1990s, and it seemed fitting that I should finally build it. It was a difficult project that severely tested my patience and skills and was the last of the projects in the aircraft-building binge to be finished.
