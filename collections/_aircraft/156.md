The first aircraft model I ever built was a 1/100 scale ex-Marusan F-84F in 1969. In 2014 I decided to recreate my early collection of aircraft models, all in 1/144 scale. This was the first one I finished. At the time, this crude Aeroclub kit was the only available 1/144 Thunderstreak. It was a challenging build, typical of early, short-run injected kits. Unfortunately the kit decals only included the diagonal red and white striped markings for the tail. I had to make my own matching decals for the horizontal stabilizers.
