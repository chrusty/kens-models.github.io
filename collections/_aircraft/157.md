This subject was a trip back in time to 1962 - to the first plastic model I saw being built (by my father). This S&M 1/144 kit is a lot better than the ancient Lincoln 1/121 kit from back then. It is cleanly moulded, fits well and has nice decals. The only real weaknesses are the thickness of all trailing edges and the prop blades and I did not attempt to improve these. I also did not add enough lead weight to the nose to keep the model sitting correctly so I made a base, painted it black and inserted a brass rod dowel through it and into the nose wheel - problem solved !
