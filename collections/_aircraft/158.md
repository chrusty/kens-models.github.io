The best of my 1970s aircraft models was a 1/72 Canberra B2 (Model 49). I built it from the 1955 FROG kit. It turned yellowish from too much Glosscote in the 1980s and I eventually discarded it in 1999. In 2014 I decided to build a new Canberra in 1/144 scale. The Amodel kit looked OK in the box but was an ill-fitting beast of a thing to build. Anyway, now that it is done, another piece of my early modelling history has been reclaimed.
