The first X-15 I built (in 1/100 scale), in 1969 (Model 28), met an unfortunate end when it semi-melted in direct sunlight in 1970. I finished a second one in 1/72 scale in 2008 (Model 128) but you can never have too many X-15s, so I built this third one, this time in 1/144 scale. The Dragon kit is very nice and is a simple and quick build.
