I built a 1/100 scale F105D in 1969. In 1982 I bought an Otaki 1/144 kit to replace it but sold it unbuilt in the mid 1990s. In 2007, I bought a new copy of the 1/144 kit, this time the re-boxed Arii version. The model was quite a difficult build due to problems with fuselage asymmetry and unusable decals.
