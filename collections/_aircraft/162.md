I wanted to build a model of the Yak-9D as part of the programme to build new models of all the aircraft subjects I built in the 1960s and 1970s. Unfortunately there was no kit in existence of any Yak-9 in 1/144th scale. As a last resort I bought a Wing Club 'gashapon' pre-painted and partly assembled model by Bandai. The model itself is effectively a snap-together plastic kit, pre-painted and with some markings sprayed on. I was able to disassemble it easily and build it like a normal kit. It is very finely detailed and looks accurate.
