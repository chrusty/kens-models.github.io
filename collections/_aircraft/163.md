I built a 1/72 scale F-86E in the early 1970s (Model 43). It was from the original 1955 FROG tooling. It is now long gone but in 2014 I decided to build a replacement for it in 1/144 scale. The little Trumpeter kit is nice and required very little extra effort. The yellow decals were somewhat transparent and so I painted over them with yellow paint for greater depth of colour.
