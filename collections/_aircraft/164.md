I built this model from a 1973 Revell tooling. It is a serious dog with no redeeming feature. Many major shapes are quite wrong, the spinner is too large and the decals are very poor. If I had known how bad it was in advance I would not have started. I tried to fix some of the problems but the wingtips and spinner are still wrong. I replaced the kit decals and the model at least now has reasonably authentic markings and colours. It looks something like a Tempest V but overall I can't say I am pleased with the end result.
