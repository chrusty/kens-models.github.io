The Handley-Page Victor is my No.1 favourite aircraft of all time. I built the old 1/96 scale FROG Victor B.1 in the 1970s to mid 1980s and made a real mess of it (Model 56). In 2014, a new Victor in 1/144 scale was an essential part of my aircraft nostalgia programme. At the time, the only decent kit in that scale was a resin one by Anigrand. It was not as decent as I thought and in fact was a very difficult build with some major shape and asymmetry issues. I had to undertake serious surgery on the kit to correct the problems. Fortunately, I had excellent reference material to guide me.
