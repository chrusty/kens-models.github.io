I was not satisfied with the Viscount 800 model I had built earlier in 2014, so I decided to build a 700 series from F-Rsin. Unfortunately, the short-run injection moulds had become very worn and the kit, though of good shape and detail, required a huge amount of cleanup and repair. However, as I wanted to finish the model in early BEA livery from the 1950s, I still had to source suitable decals. Nick Webb of Classic Airlines.com made a set of early BEA decals for me which allowed the project to go ahead. Unfortunately, they stretched easily and did not fit the moulded door detail very well. I also still had to make my own wingtip BEA lettering.
