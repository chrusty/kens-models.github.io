This was one of my more foolish project choices. I wanted to add a Halifax to my collection of 1/144 scale aircraft models. There were no plastic kits available and so instead I bought a finished diecast model on Ebay. When I received it, I was disappointed in the standard and I decided to rebuild. It was not designed to be disassembled and I did a lot of damage in the process. The only diecast part was the upper wing -everything else was a form of ABS plastic which was difficult to work with. Replacement decals were also problem but in the end I prevailed.
