The first and only vacform kit I have built. One of my favourite classes of aircraft are 1950s - 60s jets and the Supermarine Scimitar is up near the top of the group. The only kit at 1/144 scale available in 2014 was the vacform by Welsh Models. As I was keen to try my hand at a vacform, I decided to give this one a go. It was not easy but I am satisfied with the outcome.
