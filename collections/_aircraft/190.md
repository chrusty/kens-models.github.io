summary: "Soviet Tupolev Tu-14T “Bosun” Torpedo Bomber, 1952, 1/72 scale [Built 2017]

Early jets are one of my favourite modelling genres. The Tu-14 has only ever been kitted in vacform and the short-run injection offering by Red Hurricane of Russia. The latter formed the basis of this model and must rank as the worst 1/72 aircraft kit I have ever seen. Acres of flash, dodgy discoloured plastic and clear parts which rival coke bottles for thickness. I naturally wanted to build it just to see if it was possible. The finished model is acceptable at a distance but does not stand up to close scrutiny, as the photos reveal."
