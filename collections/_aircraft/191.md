One of my areas of interest is early military jets of the 1940s - early 1960s. I built this model from MPM's short-run injection kit which was tooled in 1991. It is quite basic, has butt-jointed wings, a vacform canopy and was missing one exhaust nozzle. Nonetheless, it seems reasonably sound in shape and proportion and was an enjoyable build.
