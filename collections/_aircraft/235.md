The Banshee has long been a favourite aircraft. In 2021 I set out to build the old Airfix tooling which had been in my unbuilt stash for 40 years. To build the 2P version I had to cut off the short nose and attach the longer alternative version supplied in the kit. After 40 years in the box, the kit decals were yellowed and fragile and needed careful treatment as there were no aftermarket alternatives available to replace them.
