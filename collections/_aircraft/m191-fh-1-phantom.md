US Navy McDonnell FH-1 Phantom, USS Saipan, 1947, 1/72 scale [Built 2017]

One of my areas of interest is early military jets of the 1940s - early 1960s. I built this model from MPM&#39;s short-run injection kit which was tooled in 1991.
It is quite basic, has butt-jointed wings, a vacform canopy and was missing one exhaust nozzle. Nonetheless, it seems reasonably sound in shape and proportion and was an enjoyable build
