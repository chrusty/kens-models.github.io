Luftwaffe Me 163 Komet Prototype, 1945, 1/48 scale  [Built 1987-90]

This model was built from an Italeri kit which is a repop of a Hawk tooling from 1960. The kit was crude and inaccurate. I started it as joint project with my son but we got distracted and I finished it by myself a few years later. I had built a number of aircraft models before this, in various scales but none of them have survived and that is probably a good thing as they were not good.
