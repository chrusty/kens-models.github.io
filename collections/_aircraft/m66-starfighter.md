West German Lockheed F-104G Starfighter, approx. early 1970s, 1/72 scale  [Built 1986 - 1990, upgraded 2007]

I started this old Matchbox Starfighter as a joint project with my son. We got distracted and put it aside and I came back to it a few years later during a drive to complete all my old backlog of partly-built models. I highlighted the panel lines and added the runway base in 2007.
