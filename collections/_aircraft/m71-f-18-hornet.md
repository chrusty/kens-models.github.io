F- 18 Hornet Demonstrator, 1/144 scale
[Built 1981, 1991]

This little LS kit looked good in the box with fine details but had no cockpit and also represented the pre-production, demonstrator version of the aircraft, which differed from the production machines. I was disappointed by that so I left it unfinished for 10 years before completing quickly in 1991. I opened out the cockpit, added a seat but otherwise left it unmodified. I made a mess of the paint job by not taking the time to mask and spray the dark blue and gold panels.
