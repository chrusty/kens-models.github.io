Since childhood, I have been fascinated by water towers. When I saw this kit on sale I had to have it. Although the kit is quite primitive by modern injection moulding standards, it builds into a reasonably sound replica of the prototype. I painted it with enamels and weathered it with washes and pastel chalks.
