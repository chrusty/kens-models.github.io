summary: "Windmill at Lemkenhafen, Fehmarn Island, Baltic Coast, Germany. (1787),
Claimed scale HO (1/87), actual approx 1/120, [Model Built 2022]

This very old Kibri kit, tooled in 1968, is still in production. I bought a copy in 1984, sold it in 1999 and then bought another copy in 2021. With such a chequered history, I thought I would have to build it. The kit is a proportionally inaccurate and underscale representation of the famous windmill off the Baltic coast. Still, it looks like a windmill and was fun to build."
