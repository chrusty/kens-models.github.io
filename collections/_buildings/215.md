summary: "Water Tower in Germany, typical of 1900 â€“ 1920 period, HO (1/87) scale, 
[Built 2022]

This was built from a very rough old kit and was quite a challenging build. It does not seem to be based on an actual prototype and instead appears to be a generic representation of brick, railway water towers in Germany."
