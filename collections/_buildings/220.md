summary: "Kochendorf Town Hall, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany (Built 1597)
Nominally HO scale [Model built 2022]

A famous period town hall in Germany. A straightforward build. The only addition I made was the town coat-of-arms next to the external stairway. The model is marketed as HO scale but actually scales out at about 1/115."
