summary: "Typical American Farmhouse in the 1950s (Built approx. 1900-1920s),
HO (1/87) scale  {Model built 2022]

I found this old Revell kit on Ebay in it's original &quot;Farmhouse Set&quot; packaging. The kit was tooled in 1958 and is of remarkably good quality. I chose to build it because I liked the look of the building, and because the kit is over 60 years old. I changed all the window frames with aftermarket replacements.
