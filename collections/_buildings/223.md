summary: "Urach Town Hall, Bad Urach, Baden-Wurtemburg, Germany, approx. 2015, approx 1/110 scale  [Built 2022]

This old Kibri kit (1967 tooling) is something I had wanted to build since 1984, when I bought my first copy of the kit. I sold that copy unbuilt, in a purge of my collection in the late 1990s but replaced it in 2015. The kit is a reasonable replica of the front 2/3rds of the building. For reasons unknown, Kibri shortened the model. It was quite a difficult model to build due to poor fit and alignment of the roof sections. I scratchbuilt the bell-tower dome roof and spire."
