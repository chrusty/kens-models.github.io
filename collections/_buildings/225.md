summary: "American Barn Diorama, HO (1/87) scale, [Built 2022]

I chose to build this diorama as I thought it would be something my 5-year old grand-daughter would have liked. There are 2 people, 4 horses, a tractor (made from a whitemetal kit) and an old pickup truck in the scene. My grand-daughter asked me why there were no cows !!"
