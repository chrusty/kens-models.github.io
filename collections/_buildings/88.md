summary: "Neuschwanstein Castle , Bavaria, Germany, 1/220 scale  [Built 1997-98]

This famous castle on a steep hill in south-west Bavaria was built from 1969 to 1886. It looks like it probably provided the inspiration for Disneyland castles. I built this model of it as a distraction from my usual military subjects."
