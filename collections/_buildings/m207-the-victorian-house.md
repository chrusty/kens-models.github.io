“The Victorian House” (1894), 710 Steiner St, San Francisco, HO (1/87) scale [Built 2021]

I bought a copy of one of this series of kits in 1984 and subsequently sold it again in 1996. In 2010 I visited San Francisco and saw the Painted Ladies of Steiner St in person. In 2021 I collected the full set of five kit houses. I started this one, house #5, immediately. It was a simple kit but tricky to build due to extensive warping of the walls and  fit problems between the walls and the base.
