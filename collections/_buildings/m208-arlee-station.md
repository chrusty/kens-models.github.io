Arlee Station, Montana, Northern Pacific Railroad, approx. 1950s, HO (1/87) scale, [Built 2021-22]

This diorama started with AHM&#39;s vintage Arlee Station kit. The kit was an ill-fitting, snap-together item. I had to separate all the window frames and doors to get them to fit properly.  Misalignment of the mould halves was also a major problem. When I finished the station, The model looked bare and uninteresting so I extended the base, added a section of railway track and some Preiser figures.
