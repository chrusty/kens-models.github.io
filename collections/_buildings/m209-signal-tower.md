Semaphore Signal Tower, Central Of Georgia Railroad, approx 1900, HO (1/87) scale [Built 2022]

One of my interests is old-time railroad buildings and structures. I chose to build this particular kit for two reasons;
- firstly the building is a very appealing period design, and
- secondly, the kit represented a major challenge, being heavily warped.
