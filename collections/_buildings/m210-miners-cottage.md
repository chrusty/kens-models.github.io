Restored Minerâ€™s Cottage (approx. 1870s), typical of cottages in Bendigo, Australia, HO (1/87) scale [Built 2022]

I made this humble dwelling from a very rough, 3D-printed kit I bought on Ebay. I made many improvements to it after studying photos of actual cottages. As an afterthought I added back door steps and a seated man and his small dog (shown in the last 3 photos).
