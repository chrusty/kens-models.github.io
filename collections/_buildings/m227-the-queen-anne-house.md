“The Queen Anne House” (1994), 716 Steiner St, San Francisco, HO (1/87) scale, [Built 2022]

I built this model as a companion to &amp;quot;The Victorian House&amp;quot; (M207). The kits differ only in the front facade. I modified the chimney and painted the roof and walls to match the full-sized house.
