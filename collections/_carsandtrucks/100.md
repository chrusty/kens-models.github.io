This old AMT kit had been in my unbuilt stash since 1979. After finishing 3 car models from 1999 to 2001, I got on a roll and decided to put a collection of new builds together. I have always liked the style of American coupes of the late 1930s to 40s. The 1940 Ford epitomises them. I replaced the kit tyres with the correct stock style from the spares box. I used Alclad and BareMetal foil to replace the kit chrome.
