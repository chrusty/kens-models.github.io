The full size '66 Pontiacs were great-looking cars and Hasegawa's kit looked quite straightforward in the box. However, appearances can be deceiving and I ended up replacing a number of incorrect parts with resin ones from The Modelhaus. I also had frustrations with the Tamiya metallic lacquer topcoat but it was certainly a learning experience. The first 2 photos show the model as initially completed, whereas, the last 7 photos show it with replacement wheels and the attempted paint fix to the hood
