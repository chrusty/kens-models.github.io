I originally built this kit, my first 1/25th car, in four brief periods of focus in 1975, 1979, 1987 and 1990. I painted it in black enamel but I was never happy with how it looked. So, 12 years later, in 2002, I stripped the paint, made a number of detail improvements and re-finished it in red lacquer. I also replaced the tyres with whitewalls by The Modelhaus and refinished the &quot;kit chrome&quot; parts with Alclad. It looks a lot better than it did in 1990.
