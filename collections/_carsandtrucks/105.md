Following on with my surge of building model cars, I tackled this Academy / Minicraft Ferrari 250LM kit. It is quite a decent kit, a marked contrast with their McLaren M8A. I made a few detail improvements incl PE mesh for grilles, PE windshield wipers and a hand-made lower instrument panel. My first attempt to finish the model as the Maranello Concessionaires #23 car in red with a Cambridge blue flash/stripe, was a failure. I stripped the paint and finished the model in the overall yellow of the #26 car
