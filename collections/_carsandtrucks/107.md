In about 1963-64, there was a big,1960 Dodge Kingsway sedan which regularly parked a few doors down in our street in Auckland. It was a right-hand drive, export version of a 1960 Plymouth. I loved that car, especially its massive fins and it resulted in a lifelong love of American cars of the 50s and 60s. When I saw this Johan kit with the same, familiar fins, in Brisbane in 1986, naturally, I bought it. When I finally got around to building it 14 years later, I put a lot of effort into making a worthy model and used many aftermarket parts and decals. It was a lengthy build and I am still very happy with it.
