I saw a picture of a full size 1962 Mercury Monterey in a book and loved the look of the car, especially the rocketship tailights. AMTâ€™s kit was one of their Annuals, only released once (in 1962) before the moulds were modified. Unbuilt kits are rare collectors items but I found a built example on Ebay for the relatively reasonable price of US $28. It was a gluebomb. There was a lot of surface glue damage, the windshield was history but the scripts were intact. I stripped and rebuilt the model, added some replacement Modelhaus parts and finished it in lacquer paint mixes as close I could match to the authentic colours. Unfortunately, the colours are distorted in the photos.
