For a change of pace I decided to build this little Keil Kraft bus. The kits have long been out of production but can still be found on Ebay. The model depicts T219, a preserved survivor of Greenline Coach Class 1/7T7/1 AEC Regal, Single-Decker, Front-Entrance.  These were built in 1931 and retired in ~1939. They were 26â€™ long and seated 30. The kit is a shocker and it took a lot of work to make something half-reasonable from it.
