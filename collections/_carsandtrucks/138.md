In 2009 I made the trip to Melbourne to watch the Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix. It was a great experience and I came back full of enthusiasm to build open-wheel racing cars. I started three, a 1/20 Brabham BT-50, this Indy car and a 1/24 Jordan EJ10. The kit is sound enough, though the fit of some larger body parts is average to poor. Unfortunately, I made a mistake with the placement of the sponsors decal on the wing and by the time I realised my error it was too late.
