Steam-powered traction engines are fabulous machines of a bygone era. There are very few plastic kitsets of them other than those by Keil Kraft which were tooled in the 1980s. This kit was a lot better than the previous Keil Kraft kit I built, the Greenline bus, and I made a much better job of it. However, the kit is quite simplified and I spent hours examining photos of preserved machines so as to add the missing rods, levers etc to this model. It took a lot of time but was worth it.
