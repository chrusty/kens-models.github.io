summary: "Brabham BT50, Nelson Piquet, Canadian GP, 1982, 1/20 scale 
[Built 2009, 2018]

Built from a Tamiya F1 kit tooled in 1983. These kits are reasonably difficult to build well and as it was my first one, I was on a steep learning curve. I added some photo-etch parts from Studio 27 and Acu-Stion sets."
