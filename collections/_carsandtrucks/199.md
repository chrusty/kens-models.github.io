summary: "Kenworth K123 COE ca. 1970, 1/25 scale  [Built 2008-09, 2019]

AMT's classic Kenworth Cabover. I bought it in 1974, partly assembed the engine in 1975, then put it back in the box until 2008. These AMT truck kits are not for the fainthearted. Most parts had shrinkage depressions and required filling and sanding. Keeping the chassis warp-free was another challenge, as was alignment and assembly of the exhaust system. I was pleased to complete it after 44 years."
