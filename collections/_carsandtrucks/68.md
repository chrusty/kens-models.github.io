This is my original build of the AMT 1957 T'bird which I bought in 1975. I finished the model in black enamel which I polished as best I could. The chrome-work is a mix of kit plated parts and airbrushed silver enamel. I completely rebuilt the model in 2003 (Model 104). The photos are rephotographed analog prints from an old album.
