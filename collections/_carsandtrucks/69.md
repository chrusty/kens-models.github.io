summary: "Ford C-800 Stake Truck, 1/25 scale
[Built 1975, 1979, 1984, 1990-91, upgraded 2003]

I first saw AMT truck kits for sale in Auckland in 1974 and immediately started collecting them. I started this one in 1975 and quickly worked out that it was a complex model and not a simple project to build quickly. I worked on it in four bursts of enthusiasm over a 16 year period and upgraded it further 12 years later with stake sides and cargo. Despite the basic finished model being over 30 years old now, it still looks pretty good."
