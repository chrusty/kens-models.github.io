summary: "Mercedes C-9, Le Mans 1989, 1/43 scale, [Built 1994 - 1999]

Heller had a range of 1/43 car kits. In 1993-94 I became very interested in sports racing cars and started this simple little kit as a result. It proceeded slowly, in fits and starts during the 90s until I finally finished it in 1999. "
