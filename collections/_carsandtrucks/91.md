In the early 1990s I became interested in Le Mans and Sports Prototype Racing. I started this model as my first in the genre. The Tamiya kit was designed for motorising and it needed quite a lot of work to improve its authenticity as a static display model. I made improvements to the Naca ducts, the wheel arches and the cockpit, using reference photos for guidance.
