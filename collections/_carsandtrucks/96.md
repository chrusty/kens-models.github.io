Bruce McLaren is a legend in New Zealand. As a fellow Kiwi, I wanted to make a model of one of his famous Can-Am cars. At the time I started the project, in 1993, the Academy kit was the only option I knew of. Unfortunately, it was little more than a motorised toy. The body is a strange hybrid of the M6A and M8A cars. Even knowing that, I had no idea it would take me over 200 hours to complete the model. I hand made a huge number of parts in plastic, brass and aluminium tube. I made RTV moulds of Heller 1/24 McLaren M7 wheels and cast copies. Accurate Miniatures also came to the rescue with interior parts and the windshield. I used Fred Caddy decals.
