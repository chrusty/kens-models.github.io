I had my own full-size Nissan 200SX exactly like this model, for 10 years. It was the best looking car I ever owned. Fujimi's kit is a good likeness. I made a couple of minor improvements to the kit and painted it with Tamiya yellow lacquer to match my car. In 2002, I modified the rear track so that the tyres did not extend beyond the bodywork.
