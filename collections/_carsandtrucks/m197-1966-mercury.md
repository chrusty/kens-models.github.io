1966 Mercury Parklane Marauder 2-door Hardtop, 1/25 scale
[Built 2003, 2018]

I bought this model as a used, built up on Ebay. It was in reasonable condition for a gluebomb. I disassembled it, stripped the paint and re-finished it without any significant improvements to the basic kit other than Modelhaus tail-light bezels and whitewalls..
