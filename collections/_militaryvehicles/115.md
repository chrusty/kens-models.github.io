With 607 parts, this unusual kit was an exercise in endless cleanup of track links and bridge planks. The kit did not include any mounting structures to support the bridge in travelling mode and I could not find any reference material to help with this question. I designed and made some parts to fulfill this function but they are purely speculative. I also used Vallejo water-based paints for the first (and only) time. I found them to be too soft and easily damaged.
