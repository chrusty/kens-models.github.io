This model was initially released in monthly instalments as an accompaniment with three successive issues of a Japanese magazine, Armor Modelling (Nov 2010 to Jan 2011). As I like 1930s tanks, I bought the magazines/model instalments and started work on the model soon after. This kit is very well-engineered and was a joy to build. The colour scheme was a challenge however. The model came first in the armour category at a club competition in 2012.
