Trumpeter's series of WW2 armoured train kits make large and impressive models. I had wanted to build these as soon as they were released. My plan was to have an armoured locomotive and two units behind it. The first, and only one I have built so far is this ATG-3 unit, though I have completed a 1.35 m section of track on a base with simulated railway ballast. That is long enough to fit the planned three units.
