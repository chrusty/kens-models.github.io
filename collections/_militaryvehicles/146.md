The German 8-wheel armoured cars of WW2 were very impressive-looking machines. I built a liitle Roco 1/87 scale one in 1969 and had long wanted to build another in the big scale (1/35) but I didn't get around to it until 2002. Tamiya's Sd.Kfz 232 is an old but still sound kit. The tooling was from 1974 and I bought my copy in 1975. I decided to go all out to detail this model with modern aftermarket parts. That decision certainly slowed the build down and after 2002, I made almost no progress for 9 years until a major push to finish it in 2012.
