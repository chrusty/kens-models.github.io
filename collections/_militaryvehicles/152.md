In late 2013, my interest in building small scale armour returned after over  18 years of having abandoned the scale in 1995 and then selling nearly all my unbuilt kits. This renewed interest was largely driven by a nostalgic desire to recreate the collection of small scale armour models I had built from 1969 to 1972. The first armour model I ever built was a Roco Minitanks M-40 in HO scale (Model 18), back in 1969. This Matchbox M-40 is a better kit than the old Minitanks model but the detail is a little soft. I made a few improvements to the kit to improve the scale appearance but nothing major.
