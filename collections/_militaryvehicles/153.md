In 2013 I bought this 1/72 scale Cromwell Models kit on the strength of their very nice 1/76 scale resin kits I had bought in the early 1990s. Sadly, the casting quality had gone down a lot and this kit arrived with massive lumps of excess resin between the wheels and seriously misaligned seams at the back of the turret and under the hull along with lots of air bubbles holes. With a bit of work it came up OK, though the gun barrel was short by 2 mm.
