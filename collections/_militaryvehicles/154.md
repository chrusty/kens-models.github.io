The old Airfix Churchill kit, exactly the same as the one I built in 1970 (Model 30) other than the moulds having degraded significantly after 43 years. It is a fiddly little kit to build and requires care to get the wheel / track assemblies fitted correctly. It was a trip down memory lane to build it again after all that time but sadly, the finished model has soft detail and just looks old fashioned. The one concession to modernity that I made was to replace the kit gun barrel with an RB turned aluminium barrel and machined brass muzzle brake.
