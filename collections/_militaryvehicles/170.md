This model is a replacement for a 1/76 Airfix Mark 1 that I built in 1970-71 (Model 36) and binned over 40 years ago. I built the new model from a brand new MasterBox tooling in 1/72 scale. The kit is good though the main hull pieces were badly warped. I researched the colour scheme on the internet and went to some effort to get the colours and the pattern authentic, though I have little doubt there are differences of opinion on that subject. The model represents the first use of tanks, on 15 September 1916 at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette.
