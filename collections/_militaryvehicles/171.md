I have long been a fan of Soviet and Russian armour. In 1972 I made a 1/76 T-54 (Model 37) from a very basic Midori kit. In 2014, I decided to replace it with a much better early T-54 in 1/72 scale and chose to build it from the PST kit which I had in my stash. I attempted to improve the accuracy of the kit with a metal gun barrel, a resin replacement turret and photo-etch parts. It was a major job and took far longer than any small-scale armour kit I had ever built. I am reasonably satisfied with the outcome, other than the roadwheels which are not a good representation of the early T-54 wheels.
