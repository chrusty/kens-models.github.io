The German 8-wheel armoured cars are  favourites subjects of mine ever since I built a crude, HO scale Roco Minitanks Puma in 1969. I chose the 1/72 Hasegawa kit based on favourable reviews compared with the alternatives. I did however replace the kit wheels with aftermarket resin parts. The kit was easy and enjoyable to assemble though some filling was necessary. I thoroughly researched the colours / mixes for the German three-colour camouflage scheme on the internet and I chose to brush paint the pattern (which was sprayed on the actual vehicles) because an air-brushed finish would not have turned out well at 1/72nd scale.
