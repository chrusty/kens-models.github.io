Back in 1970, I built the Airfix 1/76th Panther (Model 31). At the time, I was happy with it but unfortunately, it melted in direct sunlight (inside a glass case) in 1971, along with a number of my other 1969-70 models. By 2014, a new Panther was long overdue and I chose Revell's 1/72 scale kit. I decided to go all out with this model. I added a lot of aftermarket parts to improve it and chose the challenging, Ambush Pattern camouflage scheme to finish it in.
