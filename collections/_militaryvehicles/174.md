I had built two T34/85 models prior to this, the first in 1/76 scale by Airfix in 1971 (Model 35) and the second in 1/35 by Tamiya (Model 50). Both models are long gone but photos of the latter survive and are included on this site. In 2014, I decided to replace them with a new model. The Revell kit is a very good representation of the flattened turret Model 1945 version and I therefore chose to use it for this project. The kit itself is a joy to build, the only significant weakness being tracks which are too short by about 2/3rds of a link and which have no edge detail.
