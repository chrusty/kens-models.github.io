I had never built a Panzer 3 before this, though the long barrel 50 mm version is my favourite of the earlier German tanks prior to the Panther. The Revell kit is finely detailed and well-engineered, except for the link and length tracks which were too short. I upgraded the model with aftermarket parts including a metal gun barrel, towing cables and some photo-etch parts. I did a lot of research for the colour scheme and eventually settled on the camo pattern in the kit instructions, which was authentic for a vehicle destined for North Africa and then re-routed to southern Russia.
