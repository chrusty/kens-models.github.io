The UM kit is a reasonably accurate depiction of the M4A4 chassis and was the natural choice for a 1/72 scale Firefly model. Unfortunately, the kit is typical Eastern European in style - a lot of parts, poor fit requiring a lot of modifications and very inconvenient positioning of sprue nubs. It was time-consuming and difficult to assemble. I made a few modifications to the kit, including an RB Models turned metal 17-pdr barrel. I decided that the green and black camouflage pattern used on some British armour would help lift the model.
