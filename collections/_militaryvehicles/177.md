The last GMC truck model I had built was in 1969 to 1/87 scale (Model 20). It is the oldest of my models still in existence. I decided a new one was necessary and chose the Academy 1/72 scale kit. It is a very nice kit and I made minimal changes to it.The large array of kit-supplied cargo was a big bonus and has greatly added to the look of the model.
