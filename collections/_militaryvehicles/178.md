This M48 kit was originally tooled by Esci in 1988 and the shapes seem basically sound. Unfortunately, the kit tracks, roadwheels and return rollers are grossly simplified, the wheels being moulded as single thick wheels rather than pairs. I used a short-run aftermarket set by OKB Grigorov to correct this deficiency only to discover that the OKB wheels are underscale. Also, the OKB tracks have serious sink marks on both sides of nearly every link (which had to be filled) and fitting the wheels required substantial modification of the kit parts as well as the OKB components. All in all, a lot of work for a small model. The other major challenge was mixing a convincing Sinai Grey colour - it remains unclear whether I have achieved this. The photographs on a brown card background display the colour of the model most accurately, whereas the photos against a white background are distorted towards a more greenish tone.
