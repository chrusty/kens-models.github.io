The big German tracked mortars were very impressive machines and I was keen to build one as the centrepiece of my 1/72 armour collection. I settled on a late chassis version with the long barrel 54 cm L/11.5 gun and late war 3-colour camouflage. The HobbyBoss kit looked great in the box and is well-detailed but required quite a lot of cleanup, filling and some modifications for fit. However, by far the weakest aspect of the kit were the single piece vinyl tracks which were ~1.5 cm too short. The painting of the model did not work out as planned and overall, the model is a disappointment.
