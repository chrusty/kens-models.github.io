I settled on a late chassis Karl with the long barrel 54 cm L/11.5 gun and late war 3-colour camouflage. The HobbyBoss kit looked great in the box and is well-detailed but requires quite a lot of cleanup, filling and some modifications for fit. However, by far the weakest aspect of the kit are the single piece vinyl tracks which were ~1.5 cm too short.
