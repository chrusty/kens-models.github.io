I made this tiny model (only 57 mm long) from a kit by IBG, With 170 parts, it is a surprisingly time-consuming build. There were a few fit problems and some parts required thinning for a better scale appearance. The tracks were particularly challenging, the individual links for around the sprocket and idler being very fiddly due to their tiny size. My copy of the kit arrived without decals and I was forced to improvise. I bought a separate aftermarket decal sheet by Toro, depicting a Polish vehicle.
