I was not satisfied with the Airfix Churchill I had built in 2013 (Model 154) and decided to build a modern kit in 1/72 scale to replace it. I chose the Dragon Mk.III. Although well-moulded, with crisp detail, the fit of parts was surprisingly poor and the tracks were too short. I made a few improvements, including a turned metal barrel.
