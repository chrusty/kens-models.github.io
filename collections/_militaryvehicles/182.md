Accurate Armour's multi-media A11 has been around since the mid 1990s. It was a challenging kit to build, not least because the solid resin hull was distorted in shape. Detail on the whitemetal parts was also a little soft. I also replaced the resin kit tracks with Modelkasten T-26 individual link plastic tracks. With the addition of two lovely BEF resin figures by Passion Models, the model looks the part.
