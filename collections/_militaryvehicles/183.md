summary: "German Versuchsflakwagen 8.8cm Flak 41 auf Sonderfahrgestell (Pz.Sfl. IVc), trials, Denmark, 1944. 1/72 scale
[Built 2015]

I built this experimental vehicle from a Cromwell Models resin kit which also included parts for an anti-tank version. The kit was nicely detailed but required a lot of cleanup to fill air bubble pin-holes and remove flash and mould seams. There were no instructions or decals."
