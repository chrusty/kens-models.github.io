summary: "Soviet IS-7 Heavy Tank Prototype, Kubinka, 1948  [Built 2020-21]

I saw the mighty IS-7 at Kubinka tank museum in 2016. It was the pinnacle of Soviet WW2 heavy tank development and is exceptionally impressive in the flesh. The Trumpeter kit is good though I replaced the 130 mm gun barrel with machined metal."
