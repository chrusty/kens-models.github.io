summary: "Soviet SU-57B Tank Destroyer, 1943
[Built 2023]

I built this little known Soviet vehicle  from a 3D-printed kit by SS Models which I bought on Ebay. I had to make significant changes to the angled face of the front left side of the upper hull and also reconfigure the roadwheel and return roller positions on the left side printed track/wheel assembly. The seller did send me a corrected part but I had already made the fixes by then.."
