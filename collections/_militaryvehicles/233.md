summary: Ford Quad Field Artillery Tractor with 25-pdr, Eighth Army, Egypt 1942
title: British Quad + 25-pdr
---

Tamiya's Quad with 25-pdr kit dates back to 1974. I bought my copy in 1975 and it stayed in the stash for 46 years until I started it in 2021. Considering it's age, the kit is pretty good. The only changes I made were to add a winch cable and the upper guide roller. I had wanted to paint a &quot;mickey mouse ears&quot; camo pattern for some time and the Quad gave me the opportunity to paint the desert version of it with dark olive &quot;ears&quot; over desert pink. I also added five figures from a MiniArt British set -  two standing figures with spades plus three seated figures inside the Quad.
