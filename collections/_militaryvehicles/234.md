Some years ago I watched a video of one of these giant tractors going through its paces in the mud somewhere in eastern Europe. I thought at the time, I would love to build a model of one. About a year later I discovered a resin kit was available and I ordered it, along with a double wheel set. In 2023, I finally got around to building the model. It was very challenging, certainly not for the faint-hearted. The finished model is imposing, dwarfing most tanks in the same scale. Unfortunately I was not able to correct all the problems with the kit and some alignment issues remain
