This model is based on Tamiya's very early M8 kit which was first released in 1966. It came with motorizing gear and coarse rubber wheels. It is one of the earliest relics in my collection. The rubber tyres perished in the early 80s so I made an RTV mould of one and cast resin replacements in the mid 80s.
