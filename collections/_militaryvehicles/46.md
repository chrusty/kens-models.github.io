summary: "Soviet Army T-10 Heavy Tank, Czechoslovakia 1968, 1/35 scale
[Built 1974-77]

Tamiya's antique T-10, tooled in 1964. The kit was motorised and was the 9th in their 1/35 series, which began in 1961 with a Panther. When I bought this model in 1971, it was the only T-10 or JS-3 kit available. By modern standards, it is pretty awful. The rubber tracks perished in the mid 80s."
