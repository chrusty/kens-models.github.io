I built this model from Tamiya's original motorised T34 kit which was tooled in 1965. It originally had rubber band tracks which I replaced with a set of vinyl tracks from their new tool 1974 T34/76 kit. I made various other improvements to the kit but it remained terribly inaccurate and I junked it in 1999. The images are re-photographed old analog photos.
