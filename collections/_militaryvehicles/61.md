summary: "US Army M109 155mm SP Gun, Vietnam, early 1970s, 1/87 (HO) scale
[Built 1985 - 1990]

A Roco Minitanks kit which I built on and off over a 5 year period. It was the first armour kit I had finished in 8 years, since 1982. Although the kit is basic, I made a particular effort to weather it effectively and to correctly represent a specific vehicle in the Vietnam War."
