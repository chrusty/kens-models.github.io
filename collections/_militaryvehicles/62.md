summary: "US Army M-29C Amphibious Weasel, Korea 1951, 1/35 scale [Built 1989-90]

In 1987, I was given a collection of kits and built, partly built and scratchbuilt models by a former German (WW2) soldier. Amongst them was this old Monogram M29 Weasel made by his son. It was unpainted but in poor condition with glue damage. I disassembled, rebuilt and painted it, based on photos of an actual vehicle in the Korean war. Pity about the driver's crazy eyes. I made the scenic base in 2015. "
