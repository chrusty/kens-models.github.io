summary: "British Army Chieftain Mk 2, ca.1969, 1/76 scale  [Built 1971 - 1990]

The Airfix Chieftain kit, tooled in 1971, was one of their better small scale armour kits. Although started in 1971, I built the model almost entirely in 1990. I made a few detail changes to the turret and finished the paint in a novel way by lightly dry-brushing Humbrol brass metallic over the bronze green finish on the upper cast surfaces. Someone must have liked it because it came 1st in class at a National Comp in 1991."
