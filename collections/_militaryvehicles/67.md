The moulds for Airfix's SAM-2 were either damaged beyond repair or went missing sometime in the late 1970s - early 1980s. In 1987 I was given a large collection of old 1/76 models and parts by an older modeler. The bags of parts included partly-built components, partial sprues plus loose SAM-2 kit parts, some of them painted. Fortunately, the kit instructions were there but a number of parts, including 6 wheels, were missing. As the kit was very hard to find (pre-Ebay days), in 1990 I decided to build a model from the kit parts I had and make replacements for those that were missing.
