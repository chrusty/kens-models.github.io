summary: "Polish Army 2S1 Gvozdika SP 122 mm gun - approx. 1980s, 1/76 scale
[Built 1991]

In 1990 I became aware of resin armour kits. This is one from the UK made by Cromwell Models. It was a simple build with only 9 parts. The sharpness of detail was a pleasant surprise after building 1/76 plastic kits.  "
