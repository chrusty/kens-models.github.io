summary: "Soviet BT-7 Model 1935, 1941, 1/35 scale  [Built 1991]

I built this BT-7 from a resin and vacform kit by Lunar Models. At the time, it was the only 1/35 BT-7 available. The kit was crude and poorly cast due to RTV moulds which were well past their use-by date. The hull was mis-shapen and it took a lot of work to make a reasonable model from the kit. I learned a lot about working with resin as a result."
