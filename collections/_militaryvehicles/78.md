I made this model from Tamiya's earliest Sherman. The upper hull and turret date from their 1966 M4A3E2 and the HVSS and lower hull were tooled in 1970. I bought it in late 1971 and started it in 1972. It stayed in a partly built state for 19 years and travelled with me to different cities and countries before I finally got back to working on it in 1991-93. The model is overscale and relatively inaccurate, a product of the ancient tooling, but I am still happy with the finish.
