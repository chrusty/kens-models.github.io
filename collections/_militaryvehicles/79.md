summary: "Soviet KV-2 Heavy Assault Tank, approx 1941-42, 1/76 scale [Built 1994]

A simple project to keep me occupied at night while I was working away from home. It is a rebuild of a Fujimi kit which had been built by another modeler. I fitted brass rod stub axles to the roadwheels, idlers and sprockets so they could handle the tension of the vinyl tracks. "
