summary: "German Tiger II (Henschel), late WW2,
1/76 scale [Built 1994]

Another simple project for when I was working away from home. This old Fujimi kit had been fully assembled by another modeler. It was part of a collection I had been given. I strengthened some of the axles with brass rod, fitted the tracks and painted it."
