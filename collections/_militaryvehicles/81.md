The Fujimi 38t built and modified to a different version by another modeler. He altered the glacis plate and the idlers quite skillfully - all I did was modify the sprocket teeth to accept the tracks and paint the vehicle. This was the last of these 2nd hand, away from home projects that I started. It was an unsatisfying process that resulted in an unsatisfying model.
