summary: "German Pzkpfw 38t Tank, 1939 Poland, 1/76 scale [Built 1994]

The Fujimi 38t built and modified to a different version by another modeler. He  altered the glacis plate and the idlers quite skillfully - all I did was modify the sprocket teeth to accept the tracks and paint the vehicle. This was the last of these 2nd hand, away from home projects that I started. It was an unsatisfying process that resulted in an unsatisfying model."
