summary: "German Elefant Tank Destroyer, 1943, 1/76 scale [Built 1994]

Completion of a Fujimi kit partially started by another modeler. Other than drilling out the gun barrel and modifying the sprocket teeth to fit the tracks, I built unmodified as a simple project while I was working away from home."
