When Tamiya released their JS-3 kit in 1996, I thought Christmas had come early. Since 1970, it had been my favourite tank. I had struggled with the old Airfix 1/76 kit for 20 years (M63 - see below). Unfortunately, the Tamiya kit does not represent the main production version and it took a lot of work detailing it to bring it up to standard. I used reference work by Steve Zaloga extensively, in particular an article he wrote in Military Modelling in September 1997 entitled Upgrading Tamiya's Stalin. I used Eduard's PE set for details (though some parts were overscale and had to be modified) and a Verlinden figure and cobblestone base.
