Czechoslovakian T-72M1, on exercises approx. late 1990s, 1/35 scale
[Built 2015-16]

The T-72 is a great-looking tank in my opinion and I had wanted to build a model of one for many years. When I saw one up close at Saumur in 2015, I decided to get started with Tamiya&#39;s 1/35 scale kit. To achieve greater authenticity, I replaced a number of kit parts with aftermarket alternatives from MiniArm, RB Models, Voyager, SKP and Eureka XXL. I chose the most colourful paint scheme I could find (Czech) and used decals by Echelon.
