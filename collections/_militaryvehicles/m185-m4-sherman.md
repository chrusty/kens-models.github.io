Re-Manufactured Early-Mid Production M4 Sherman, US 2nd Armoured Division, France, August 1944, 1/35 scale, [Built 2016]

I built a 1/76 scale Airfix M4 Sherman back in 1971 and discarded it long ago. It never did justice to the subject and so I decided in 2016 to make a decent M4 in 1/35 scale. This model, based on the Tamiya kit, is the result. I went to some lengths to improve the kit with aftermarket parts and realistic stowage and used reference material extensively.
