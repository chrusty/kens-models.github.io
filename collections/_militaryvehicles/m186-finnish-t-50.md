Finnish T-50 Light Tank, Summer 1944, 1/35 scale  [Built 2016]

The Soviet T-50 was a very nice looking little tank in my opinion. Examples captured by the Finns were up-armoured with applique plates on the turret sides. I built this model from a HobbyBoss kit. I replaced the turret and drivers hatch with aftermarket resin parts by MiniArm, used Aber gun barrels and made a few other detail improvements.
