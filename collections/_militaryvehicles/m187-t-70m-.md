Soviet T-70M Light Tank, Kharkov, Winter 1943, 1/35 scale [Built 2016]

My primary interest in armour modelling is Soviet and Russian tanks. MiniArt&#39;s T-70 has been around a while now and though a decent kit, it does have some accuracy issues. I replaced the turret and drivers hatch with Komplekt Zip resin alternatives and the 45 mm gun barrel and the Degtyarev (DP) machine gun barrel with Aber turned brass. The PE fret and set of winter figures included with the kit are big positives. I used Tamiya diorama paste to simulate the snow.
