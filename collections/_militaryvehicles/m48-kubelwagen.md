German Kubelwagen, European Theatre WW2, 1/48 scale
[Built 1975 - 1979]

Bandai started releasing a range of detailed static armour models in 1/48th scale in 1972. I built up quite a collection of them but only built one - this Kubelwagen. The kit was very nice and assembled easily. I abandoned 1/48 scale armour in the mid 1990s (preferring 1/35 and 1/72) and sold the entire unbuilt collection of 30&#43; Bandai kits. Tragic.
