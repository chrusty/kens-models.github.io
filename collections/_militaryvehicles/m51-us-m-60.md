US Army M-60 Medium Tank, 1960s , 1/48 scale  [Built 1974, 1980-81]

One of Tamiya&#39;s old range of 1/48 scale motorised mini tanks from 50&#43; years ago. I went to some effort to improve the model with extra detail and lower hull corrections. The first set of rubber tracks perished by the late 80s. Tamiya kindly provided a new set, and they remain intact after 30&#43; years thanks to leaving them unpainted.
