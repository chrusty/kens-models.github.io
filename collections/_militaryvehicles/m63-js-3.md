Soviet JS-3 Heavy Tank, Berlin May 1945, 1/76 scale [Built 1970 - 1990]

After starting this old Airfix kit as a teenager, the partly built model travelled around with me from house to house, city to city, job to job, country to country for 20 years. It was in the too-hard basket but I was reluctant to chuck it out and so instead I finished it in a burst of enthusiasm. I made a major error with the Dushka ring mount, and the vinyl tracks look terrible, but it still looks like a JS-3.
