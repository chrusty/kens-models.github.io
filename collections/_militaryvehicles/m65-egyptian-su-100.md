Egyptian SU-100M (Czechoslovakian-built), approx. 1959, 1/35 scale
[Built 1974 - 1990]

Tamiya&#39;s SU-100 was tooled in 1966 -one of their original motorised tanks with rubber-band tracks. I bought it by mail-order from the UK in 1972. It arrived in a crushed box and the upper hull was broken into many pieces. I repaired it and then worked on it intermittently during the 1980s until an intense effort to finish it in 1989-90. As my earlier attempts to build old rubber band motorised tanks by Nichimo and Tamiya, up until 1982, had not been very satisfying in terms of historical authenticy, I went all out on this old kit to make something decent from it. That is why the build took over 180 hours. I proved it could be done but it was probably not a sensible use of time.
