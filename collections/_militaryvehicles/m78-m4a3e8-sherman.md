US Army M4A3E8 Sherman (76mm HVSS), Korean War, 1/35 scale
[Built 1972, 1991-93]

I made this model from Tamiya&#39;s earliest Sherman. The upper hull and turret date from their 1966 M4A3E2 and the HVSS and lower hull was tooled in 1970. I bought it in late 1971 and started it in 1972. It stayed in a partly built state for 19 years and travelled with me to different cities and countries before I finally got back to working on it in 1991-93. The model is overscale and relatively inaccurate, a product of the ancient tooling, but I am still happy with the finish.
