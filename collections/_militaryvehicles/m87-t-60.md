Soviet T-60 Light Tank, approx. 1942 ,
1/35 scale [Built 1995-96, upgraded 1999]

Zvezda&#39;s first 1/35 scale armour kit and to be blunt, a total dog - crude and lacking detail. In 1999, after completing the model 3 years earlier, I noticed that the vinyl track material was reacting with and melting the polystyrene of the running gear. I replaced the roadwheels, sprockets and idlers with superior and undamaged parts from an Aeroplast T-60 kit  but left the Zvezda return rollers which were too firmly glued in place to remove. l also used the Aeroplast link and length tracks. The model is still quite ordinary but at least it is not being eaten by its tracks now.
