All of my extant completed models are now accessible on the site, with photos and descriptive texts.

Although I started keeping a few records of my modeling from the late 1970s, it was not until 1987 that I started (and have continued) a proper modelling diary, documenting what I had done and the time spent on it.  Also from about 1986-87, I started making simple hand-written lists of the changes I had made to models I completed. From about 2000, the lists morphed into typed Model Description Sheets on my PC.

In about 2020, I set about retrospectively writing these descriptions for every model I had ever built - based partly on my old hand-written notes, my diaries and other scattered records and partly from memory.  During this process, I also created my chronological numbering systems for all my Projects and for the Finished Models. Though my first attempt at model photography was in 1981, I only really got going during 1988. Until 2007, all my model photos were analog, though from 2003, good quality digital versions were also supplied by the processor.  Since 2007 I have used digital photography only. I keep all the digital images in Project files on my PC, including photos of the unbuilt kits, in-progress photos if I have any, plus research images I have found on the internet. In 2020, I made a concerted effort to photograph all of my models which I had not previously photographed. I did this simply to build up my own, computer-based photo album.

So, in 2022, when I decided I was going to create a website dedicated to my hobby, the model descriptions, photo collections and the chronology, were already there to facilitate it. Nonetheless, I still needed to condense and rewrite the Model Descriptions to a shorter form (as the Model Biography screen-shots on Flickr), write introductions for categories and each model on Flickr and to do a massive amount of photo-editing / manipulation.

What remains to be done is to replace /augment the poorer quality photos and refine some of the Model Biographies. Also, now that I can get back to modeling, as I complete models I will add them to the site. I may also write in-box reviews occasionally and anything else to do with modeling that takes my fancy.

A big thanks to Chris who convinced me to use Flickr for the photo hosting platform and then set up the website itself. Without his know-how, none of this would exist.
