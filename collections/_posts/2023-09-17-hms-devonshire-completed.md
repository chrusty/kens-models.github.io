County Class missile destroyer HMS Devonshire joins the 1/700 scale fleet



<!--more-->



A few days ago I finished this old resin and whitemetal kit by Hi Mold / Clipper of Japan. I made minimal changes to the kit and the build took less time than most of my 1/700 projects. Additions / changes were limited to PE railings & netting, brass rod masts, turned brass barrels and 3DP figures. As chance would have it, Starling Models released a new and more highly detailed resin/3DP/PE kit of sistership HMS Kent soon after I had committed myself to the project - such is life.
