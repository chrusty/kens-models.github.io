Good progress recently on my two currently active projects



<!--more-->



Tamiya Quad with 25-pdr - completed the 25-pdr, the limber and six figures. Currently working on the Quad interior and body. After that, the scenic base will need additional groundwork and placement of the two standing figures.



Balaton Kirovets K-700A tractor (1/35th) - this has been a tricky kit but the chassis, wheels and engine are now nearly complete other than some further weathering. There is still quite a bit of work to do on the cab though and the window glass is going to be a challenging job.
