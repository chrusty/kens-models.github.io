Three new models finished in December & January



<!--more-->



In December I finished the vintage Tamiya Quad & 25-pdr. It sits on a simulated western desert scene. I added a number of MiniArt figures to liven up the display



Also in December, I finished the giant Kirovets K-700A tractor. It was a very difficult model to build but ultimately a most imposing addition to the 1/35th collection. However, I would not recommend it to inexperienced modellers.



Finally, in January this year, I finished the Airfix F2H Banshee, the first aircraft model for years.



I have uploaded a few pictures of all three models to the Flickr site.



More photos of the last five models from 2023-24 will be posted when I get around to setting up a photo session with DSLR, tripod and background boards.
