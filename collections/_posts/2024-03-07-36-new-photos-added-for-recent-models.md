I have posted a new series of photos of four of my recent 2023-24 models; F2H-2P Banshee, British Quad gun tractor with 25-pdr gun, Soviet SU-57B tank destroyer and County Class missile destroyer HMS Devonshire.

I took the photos using a Panasonic DMC-GF1 Micro FourThirds camera mounted on a tripod and activated by a remote shutter release. I alternated between two lenses; a Panasonic Leica DG 45mm Macro (40mm in 35mm equiv), and a Panasonic Lumix G 20mm lens (40mm in 35mm equiv). For maximum depth of field I set the camera to aperture priority / minimum aperture - F22 for the Macro and F16 for the 20mm lens.

The photos were all taken indoors, using natural light and with neutral card backgrounds to highlight the models.



Unfortunately, many of the photos are not as good as I had expected. Whilst the depth of field is excellent, the colour reproduction and crispness of focus could be better. In the latter respects, I have had better results from my handheld S20 cellphone and Panasonic TZ110. This leaves me scratching my head.
