By 2004, after 4 years building only  cars and ships, I felt like a change of pace and started this German steam locomotive. I had been interested in steam locos for 30 years but this was the first serious one I attempted. I made a lot of improvements to the kit, the most notable being to add steampipes underneath the boiler and to reconfigure the right side driving rods/running gear to correctly represent the 90-degree phase offset between the left and right sides.This involved cutting apart and then rejoining in different positions, many of the kit parts, and making some new parts from scratch.
