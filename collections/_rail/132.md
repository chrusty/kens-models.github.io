In 2008 I bought a collection of old built-up OO scale railway stuff on Ebay. This old Airfix tank wagon was one of them. It was a genuine glue-bomb, with serious glue damage and a lot of missing parts. I stripped it and replaced the missing parts with spares from other built-ups plus a few handmade bits and pieces. I had intended that it would become a component of a rail diorama set in 1960 - and in 2018 it did.
