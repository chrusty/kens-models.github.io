title: Diesel Shunter
---

When my kids were very young, I used to read them Thomas the Tank Engine books at bedtime. In one of the books, Duck and the Diesel Engine, there was a nasty, oily, diesel-electric shunter that looked just like the 08 Class. Kitmaster made a decent kit of the 08 Class in 1959. I thought one of those would look good in my British Rail diorama.  I made the model from a built up glue-bomb Kitmaster 08 which I bought on Ebay as part of a collection. I disassembled, stripped and repaired it with spare parts from another similar 08 glue-bomb. Building the model brought back fond memories of the childrens stories.
