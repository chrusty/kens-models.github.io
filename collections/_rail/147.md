When I designed the 1960 British Rail diorama in 2008, the Airfix 20 ton Brake Van was one of the key items of rolling stock I wanted to include in it. I bought a new Dapol copy of the kit for the purpose. The kit was in poor condition and required a lot of cleanup, repair of broken parts and hot-water treatment of a serious warp in the floor. I put a lot of effort into making a decent model from this humble starting point and am happy with the outcome.
