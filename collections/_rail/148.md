I found this bagged kit on sale in a technical bookshop, bought it, started it and bingo, I was into a whole new period of research, kit collecting and building. The  tooling of the kit is ancient but it still has pretty good detail. Sadly, there were no clear plastic parts for the windows and one set of steps was also missing. I took a long time for the build and made a lot of improvements along the way based on photos of the actual prototype.
