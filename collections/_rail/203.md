summary: "Japanese (JGR) Class 7100 “Benkei”, Hokkaido, early 1880s, 1/50 scale
[Built 2020]

This class of narrow-gauge locomotives are quite famous in Japan and at least 2 have been preserved in museums. In the mid1970s I built an N-gauge kit of Benkei by Crown (actual scale approx 1/106). When I found a 2nd hand copy of the much more detailed 1/50 Nitto kit, I knew I had to build it. It was a lot more tricky than I had imagined as the tooling dates from 1969."
