“End of the Line for Steam Power - Diesel Moving In”
Fictional Railyard Scene, Lancashire, England, 1959-1960, 1/76 (OO) scale
[Built 2008 - 2018]

I got the idea for this diorama after finding a second-hand kit of the Deltic prototype locomotive in a bookshop in Melbourne in 2008. The actual locomotive toured the UK in 1959-60 on trials as an a moving advertisement for diesel-electric power. I made all the structures and rolling stock in the diorama from plastic kits, with the exception of the Morris Minor British Rail van. The scene is entirely fictional, though to the best of my knowledge, the items in it are plausible for the period and the Lancashire location.
