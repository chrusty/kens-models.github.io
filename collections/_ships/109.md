This class of IJN subchasers were attractive little ships and Tamiya's kit seemed like a good representation. However, initial appearances of a kit can be deceiving and I made many changes to improve the level of detail and accuracy of this model. I could have gone further as the 3 inch gun is still a little over-scale, but I felt 39 hours was enough time spent for such a small model.
