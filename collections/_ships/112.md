I made this model for my father for his 80th birthday. He served on HMS Amethyst in 1945 - 1946. The model is based on a resin and white-metal kit of sister ship HMS Wild Goose. I made a large number of changes to the kit including replacing the bridge and fore shelter deck with scratchbuilt parts.
