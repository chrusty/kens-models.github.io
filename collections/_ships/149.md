At the time of her arrival in Australian waters in 1871, Cerberus was one of the most powerful warships in the Southern hemisphere. She was the first ship to have the classic pre-dreadnought layout with twin turrets fore and aft and a central superstructure between them. The model represents the ship early in it's career before the flying deck was shortened. I made many changes to the Combrig kit to enhance the level of detail.
