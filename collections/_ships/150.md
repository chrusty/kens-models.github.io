With the aid of 1/200 plans and photos of a 1/100 model by PG Huff, I was able to built this detailed model of the famous German cruiser Emden as she appeared at the time of her destruction in 1914. The starting point was the 1994 Revell plastic kit. It was a major project spread over 8 years. After I had completed the model, I was advised that the 5.2 cm secondary guns had probably been removed before WW1 began.
