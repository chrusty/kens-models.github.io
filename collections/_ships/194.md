In 2003 I bought 2 copies of IHPâ€™s HMS Wild Goose kit with the intention of building in parallel two different versions of Modified Black Swan Class sloops. Whilst I finished one of them in 2004 as HMS Amethyst (M112), the other one lingered as a partly-built backlog item for another 14 years until I found the enthusiasm to complete it as HMS Wild Goose in 1943. The 2 models stand in contrast, with different masts, radars and light AA. The colourful Western Approaches camo scheme for Wild Goose is a further contrast between them.
