The most time-consuming project I have done. The model is based on the old Italeri Forrestal kit from 1988. It required an endless stream of aftermarket parts, handmade corrections, replacements and added details to bring it up to a reasonable standard. The project dragged on for 12 years. The model represents Forrestal in the Mediterranean in her pre-SLEP configuration. All aircraft squadron insignia were researched and then hand-painted. As I like Vigilantes, I included a pair of visiting RA-5C from the USS Nimitz, which are on-deck and ready for launch - a purely fictional event but still plausible as Nimitz was in also in the Med at this time.
