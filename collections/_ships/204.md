This model is based on the vintage Revell tooling from 1966, released under the title British Vosper MTB. According to the experts, the kit most closely resembles a US licence-built boat, made under Lend-Lease for the Soviet Union but never delivered. The project was time-consuming as it involved added hand-made parts, aftermarket photo-etch and correcting a warp in the hull.
