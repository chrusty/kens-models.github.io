I chose to build this model because the subject has a long and checkered history for me. I built the Airfix 1/600 kit very badly in 1964, then rebuilt the same model to a better, but still underwhelming standard, in 1974.  I wanted to finally get it right and also do it in 1/700 scale. That became possible when I found this very nice resin and white-metal kit by Hi Mold in 2008. Although it dates back to the early days of resin kits and had no photo-etch, it was vastly superior to the Airfix kit. I finally got around to building the model in 2023. I have made a few detail improvements to the kit to bring it up to modern standards. Unfortunately, soon after I started the project, a new and even more detailed kit of sister ship HMS Kent was released by Starling Models.
