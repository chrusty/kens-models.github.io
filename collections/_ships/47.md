Though I had built many 1/600 ships in the 1960s, I chose this kit for my first foray into 1/700 scale due to its simplicity plus Tamiya's reputation for accuracy. Although both the kit and the build are crude by current standards, I have kept this little relic to remind me how far I have progressed in 45 years
