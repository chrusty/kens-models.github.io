I built this model from one of the early Classic Warships resin and white-metal kits which dated from the very early days of resin warship models. The kit was craftsman-style and required a lot of effort to complete. I replaced most of the bridge with handmade parts and fabricated the masts from brass rod. In January 2001, the model was badly damaged and I had to rebuild the masts. I took the opportunity to mount it on a scenic base and add figures.
