I first built this model in 1965. My parents found in their attic when they were clearing up to move house in 1987. I decided to rebuild it as a waterline model in WW2 troopship configuration. I was fortunate to have a superb reference book to guide the project. I worked on the model off and on for 14 years and it took a great amount of time and patience.
