I built this Classic Warships kit as a companion to the Seydlitz. Both ships are represented as immediately before the Battle of Jutland. I went to a lot of effort to improve the accuracy and level of detail. At the time, it was the only kit of HMS Lion available. Better kits have since appeared but IMHO, this model still holds up well against models built from the newer kits
