MTB 66 Returns to Base, RN  70-foot Vosper MTB, English Channel, Summer 1942, 1/700 scale  [Built 1999 &amp;amp; 2003]

I built the 1/700 Vosper as a stand-alone model in 1999 and subsequently decided to build a small diorama around it in 2003. The Vosper required a lot of detailing to improve the old Pitroad kit. The dock and other items are mostly resin castings by White Ensign Models.
