Royal Navy Destroyer HMS Eskimo, Narvik, April 1940, 1/700 scale  [Built 2004-2006]

HMS Eskimo at speed in Ofotfjord, 13 April 1940 (Second Battle of Narvik). The British Tribal Class destroyers were attractive-looking ships. The first model I ever built solo, was the Airfix 1/600 HMS Cossack. I built this much more detailed model of a Tribal Class from a Samek resin kit.
