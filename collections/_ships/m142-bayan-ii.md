Russian Armoured Cruiser Bayan (ii), October 1917, 1/700 scale  [Built 2006-2011]

This model was built from a Kombrig resin kit and portrays the ship at the time of the Battle of Moon Sound when she encountered the German battleship Konig (and survived). Correcting and detailing the kit was a major undertaking.
