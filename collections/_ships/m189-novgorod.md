Russian Coast Defence Battleship Novgorod, Black Sea early 1880s,  1/350 scale  [Built 2016]

The Russian round battleships are rightly quite famous and a number of resin kits have been produced of the first one, Novgorod. However, all the kits depict the ship in one of the early (1870s) configurations. I wanted to model her in her main configuration of the 1880s-90s. The changes and additional detailing necessary to achieve this were substantial and I could not have done it without a Russian language monograph supplied to me by Alexey Doronin of Moscow.
