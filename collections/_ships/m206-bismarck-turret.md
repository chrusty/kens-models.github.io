Bismarck Turret “Bruno”, 26-27 May 1941, North Atlantic, 1/72 scale  
[Built 2021]

Takom&#39;s kit of Bismarck&#39;s 15 inch B-turret was an obvious choice for a ship modeler like me. The kit is sound and includes quite a lot of photo-etch brass details. I replaced the kit gun barrels with turned aluminium aftermarket barrels which look a lot better than the original plastic ones.
