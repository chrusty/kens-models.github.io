Imperial Japanese Navy  Destroyer Shiratsuyu, approx. 1942, 1/700 scale
[Built 1974-78]

Though I had built many 1/600 ships in the 1960s, I chose this kit for my first foray into 1/700 scale due to its simplicity plus Tamiya&#39;s reputation for accuracy. Although both the kit and the build are crude by current standards, I have kept this little relic to remind me how far I have progressed in 45 years
