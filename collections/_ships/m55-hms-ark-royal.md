HMS Ark Royal, 1940, 1/600 scale
[Built 1966, 1984-85]

The old Airfix Ark Royal. I started it as a teenager and promptly lost interest but came back to it and completed it two decades later. It was the first ship model I mounted in a sea-scape for. The sea was originally blue but has turned green due to yellowing of enamel gloss varnish. Other than drilling out portholes and cutting the hull to waterline, it is virtually box stock.
