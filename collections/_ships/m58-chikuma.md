IJN Heavy Cruiser Chikuma, approx 1943, 1/700 scale  [Built 1981, 1986-87]

I built this from the original Fujimi Waterline series kit which was tooled in 1971. At the time I was happy with how it turned out but it looks terribly dated now with any photo-etch or rigging.
I plan to update the model in the near future.
