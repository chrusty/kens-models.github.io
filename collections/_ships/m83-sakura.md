IJN Destroyer Sakura, 1945, 1/700 scale  [Built 1994-95]

This model is based on the original Fujimi kit from 1972. I attempted to improve it with a few Pitroad replacement parts. I also took the opportunity to experiment with weathering techniques.  Unfortunately the model turned out poorly but I did learn from the experience.
