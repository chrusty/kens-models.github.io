U-Boat Type VIIC, Approx 1941-1942, 1/700 scale [Built 1998, upgraded 1999 - 2003]

After the relative failure of my two previous 1/700 ship models, I was determined to improve my standards. On the basis of excellent tips from my friend Lester Abbey, I was able to achieve the standard I was seeking.
