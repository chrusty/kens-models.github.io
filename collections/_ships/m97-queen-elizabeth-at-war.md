HM Troopship Queen Elizabeth, Sydney Harbour, March 1941, 1/600 scale
[Built 1987 - 2001]

I first built this model in 1965. My parents found in their attic when they were clearing up to move house in 1987. I decided to rebuild it as a waterline model in WW2 troopship configuration. I was fortunate to have a superb reference book to guide the project. I worked on the project off and on for 14 years and it took a great amount of time and patience.
