My interest in trains and railways goes back to my days as a student in the early &amp; mid 1970s, when one of my colleagues, Peter Hill, who was a steam enthusiast, introduced me to his collection of NZR memorabilia. I was soon hooked. The first kits I bought were in 1974, a Japanese 7100 class (2-6-0) &quot;Benkei&quot; narrow-gauge locomotive in N-scale and a Japanese D51 (2-8-2) by Otaki in 1/50 scale. I built the Benkei (Model 41) in 1974 but it was a very ordinary little model. The D51 remains in the stash waiting for a rainy day. Then, in the 1980s, a series of HO scale kits were released by Monogram, Revell and Esci and I collected a number of these and then a couple more of the Japanese 1/50 scale kits. However, it was not until 2004 that I made a break from my usual ships/tanks/cars/aircraft subjects and finally started my first serious train model, the HO scale Revell BR01 (Model 111). I was sufficiently pleased with the outcome of the model to want to build more.

In 2008, while in Melbourne, browsing at my favourite technical book shop, I came across a second-hand unbuilt plastic kit of the British Deltic diesel-electric locomotive. It was produced by Dapol, and as I subsequently discovered, was one of a large range of 1/76 (OO) scale locomotive models originally made by Kitmaster between about 1959 and 1963. I bought the kit and started it. A binge of train-related kit collecting followed and I also decided to make a diorama around the Deltic model. That story is explained further in the model notes below. I eventually finished the Deltic in 2012 (Model 148) and the British Rail Diorama in 2018 (Model 193). 

In 2020, during the Covid pandemic, I decided to build another steam locomotive model. I chose the bigger scale (1/50) Nitto kit of the Japanese 7100 class &quot;Benkei&quot;, as that class were particularly attractive little engines and also because I was never satisfied with my inadequate N-scale Benkei model I built in 1974. The next step will be to finally build the 1/50 scale D-51 ... sometime.
